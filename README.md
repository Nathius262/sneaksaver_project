# Sneaksaver
Owners of sneakers regularly face the challenge of maintaining a high-grade condition for their favourite sneakers. As a result, these sneakers either get disposed, sold for little money or just get left to waste at home. The solution to this is SneakSaver – a web application dedicated to providing professional sneaker cleaning services to customers. The platform will use machine learning which allows users to upload an image of the sneaker they would like to get clean service for by using the Sneaker recognition tool. Data analytics and User insights will also be used to analyse data such as the most popular sneakers searched for and requested by customers for clean service. The topics involved in this project are full stack web development, machine-learning and Data analytics.

## Tools and skills	

In this project of designing, developing and deploying SneakSaver as a finished functional platform embedded to meet the requirements stated I will be using various skills and tools to help make sure that these requirements will be met. I will be discussing the tools and skills I will be utilising to create my Sneaker-recognition tool using machine-learning and optimizing and maintaining high standards of the platform by using data analytics to track user insights on the platform. Secondly, I will go into discussing the UI aspect of SneakSaver and how I will look to develop the best UI for my overall project.
### 1.	Sneaker recognition tool in SneakSaver

#### Tools
In order to develop my sneaker recognition tool, I will be using Python as my key primary programming language for creating this tool. I will be using the software both from my home device as well as University laptops/computers in order to allow me to save my progress via my University’s H drive which allows me to access my work from both devices in different locations. I have done some extensive research and as well as using python as my programming language I will also be using machine learning libraries such as Keras or PyTorch.

#### Skills
I will be using python as my programming language as I have a lot of experience using this programming language from work previously conducted in my college years as well as my first years at university. As well as this, I will be advancing my knowledge in machine-learning concepts in order to fully understand how with the integration of machine-learning I will be able to create a platform which will have a image recognition tool that will be able to find patterns in images to recognize objects, classes and categories (mathsworks.com). Machine-learning concepts will be very important for me to have knowledge on as CNNs especially are needed for image recognition which is a network architecture for deep learning that learns directly from data. In this case in SneakSaver once an image of a specific shoe model is uploaded then that shoe will have patterns in the image so that the tool is able to recognize specific information of that shoe.


### 2.	Data analytics to track user-insights.

#### Tools
I will look to track user-insights and information on the SneakSaver platform which will show me information such as website traffic and user behaviour in order to specify the most popular searches and what users visit most on my website. Google analytics is a widely used and powerful web analytics tool that will allow me to track and analyze traffic on SneakSaver. 

#### Skills
I will develop my understanding in UX and the main principles how how user interact with websites so that when it comes to using Google analytics in order to setup tracking the visual data and user behaviour on the platform.

### 3.	User-interface of SneakSaver
Tools
I will be using a tool called “figma” which is a free to use tool that allows you to design the user interface and to create mockups, prototypes and frameworks. 

#### Skills
SneakSaver will be a web application upon being finalised as a functional and working platform that has met all the requirements, I have set to fulfil. Although I am proficient in HTML and CSS I will be looking I intend to develop my skills with more advanced programming languages being involved in building my web application such as Javascript. I believe Javascript will help me a lot to create a UI that will be user-friendly and interactive with end-users. 

I will be using MySQL also as my database to store data regarding my users in SneakSaver which will be conducted from the user form they will fill with their personal preferences and their details.
